# if intersection occurs, return:
# ---------------
# (cf.id, pt_one, pt_two, 1/0)
# -------------
# CF.ID - ID OF THE OLD_CF
# Points are sored with clockwise rotation in mind.
# pt_one - "left" side intersection
# pt_two - "right" side intersection
# 1/0: 1 means it overlaps, 0 means it just touches.

# if no intersection, return None.
