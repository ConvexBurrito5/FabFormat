Arcs are the most complex shapes.
I have still not made up my mind. I can get away with traditional symmetrical arcs for
everything I have done so far.
This may be overcomplicating things, but I have to believe that eventually supporting some form
of complex arc will be required.
Whether that ends up being asymmetrical arcs, splines or b-splines.
What form requires it. I'm not sure, but I have to believe that its required.


TLDR: RN ONLY SYMMETRICAL ARCS ARE SUPPORTED
