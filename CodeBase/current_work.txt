CONFIG COMPLETED
EXCELLON COMPLETED

- REMOVE ALL LINEAR TRACE CALLS FROM GERBER/EXCELLON or update and replace with CF POLYGONS.
- MAKE ALL POLYGONS CREATE CF LINEAR OBJECTS AND STORE.

- Methods in cf_composite_parent to verify.

- Add CommonForm complex shapes.
    - Update CFComplexParent to contain all 'squared shapes' all shapes that are bounded, so polygons and that curve
    - Cublic Spline trace object that takes in a list of points and creates a list of formulas for
        all curves in the overall curve.
    - Rework Linear Trace to be a point to point line to only be used for the creation of rectangles etc..
        - rework rectangle to take linear traces.? maybe...
    - Create a complex shape that can be bounded by curves or Linear traces. 100% fill... maybe. probably...
        - on creation test for the bounded curves or linear traces crossing anywhere besides the end points.
- Finish Gerber
    - Finish main GERBER switcher.
- Finish CFMethods
    - Create Core traces
    - Populate modified additive traces by subtracting subtractive from additive
    - Do this logic based on what outfiles are present.
    - CFIntersection detection and handling for additive + subtractive
    - look at unit of the cf method, convert the unit before making outfile
- GCode.
    - Write primary traces to print additive
    - Write secondary traces to print core


Future:
- Roll own CF Parametric Cubic Spline solution to save from having to be dependent on package.
