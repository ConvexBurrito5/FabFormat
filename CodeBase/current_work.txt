- Finish Gerber
       - polygon aperture -> cf
       - Finish main GERBER switcher.
- Verify Correct Units are being pulled and converted if have to be.
    - Added 'unit' to all apertures and stuff. Maybe a problem. remember for then
- Verify that Excellon traces are read after all 'additive instructions' check for overlap with existing primary trace.
- Finish logic on vias.
    - Verify the logic between subtractive and exclusive subtractive traces in CF
    - IF EXCLUSIVE SUBTRACTIVE TRACES INTERSECT WITH A PRIMARY TRACE, CONSIDERED A VIA. CARRIED BETWEEN LEVELS.

- CF intersection detection
- Removing additive + subtractive CF overlap
- CF -> GCode.
    - Gcode config File
- Read in config from json.
    - Infiles are seperated into their category, additive/subtractive,

- Verify that CF is general enough to work in an additive and subtractive setting.
    - Implementing additive, subtractive and exclusive.
    - Additive is trace
    - Subtractive removes from additive and stops core
    - exclusive stops core but does not remove from additive.
    - core backfills from empty space within outline and not additive, subtractive, exclusive.
