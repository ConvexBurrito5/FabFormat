- Methods in cf_composite_parent to verify.
- "cf_find_edge_route"
- Handling overlaps with CF shapes.
    - Create method called map shapes.
    - Travels along each shape checking for intersections with one another.
        - Checks if an overlap or touching.
        - If overlap add to the overlap method.
        - If touching add to the touching method.
    - Once this is done. Allows for shapes to be subtracted from effectively.
        - Also allows for more efficient plotting to be done in the future.


- Finish Gerber
    - Finish main GERBER switcher.
- Finish CFMethods
    - Create Core traces
    - Populate modified additive traces by subtracting subtractive from additive
    - Do this logic based on what outfiles are present.
    - CFIntersection detection and handling for additive + subtractive
    - look at unit of the cf method, convert the unit before making outfile
- GCode.
    - Write primary traces to print additive
    - Write secondary traces to print core


Future:
- Roll own CF Parametric Cubic Spline solution to save from having to be dependent on package.
- Add a math config to add variables when calculating math. Currently values hardcoded. ;(
    -the number of samples from segment arc,
    -the number of samples from curves,
    -the number of samples from parametricCubSpline
- Update the logic behind circle segments when calculating distance too and from. Add some optimizations.
- Put Gerber Aperture Macro and Aperture types under one parent to allow for similar methods to be merged.
- Update gerber D01 arcs to handle edge cases
    - CF:"cf_determine_extreme_point" needs to be able to handle
        - CF shapes not touching... (happens if Aperture Macro has two seperated shapes)
        - Instances where there are two+ extreme points are at the same distance.
    - Update Gerber D01 Arcs to interpret all cf_determine_extreme_point returns.
- UPDATE CF:
    - Add a CF memory value that stores what cf shapes are touching that shape.
