- polygon aperture -> cf
- Rectangle Aperture -> cf
- CF intersection detection
- Removing additive + subtractive CF overlap
- CF -> GCode.
- Read in config from txt.
- Verify Correct Units are being pulled and converted if have to be.
- Gcode config File
- Verify that gerber traces are being created in the correct position and not at 0,0.
- Verify that Excellon traces are read after all 'additive instructions' check for overlap with existing primary trace.

- Finish logic on vias.
    - Verify the logic between subtractive and exclusive subtractive traces in CF
    - IF EXCLUSIVE SUBTRACTIVE TRACES INTERSECT WITH A PRIMARY TRACE, CONSIDERED A VIA. CARRIED BETWEEN LEVELS.

- Verify that CF is general enough to work in an additive and subtractive setting.
