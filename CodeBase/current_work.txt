CONFIG COMPLETED
EXCELLON COMPLETED

- REMOVE ALL LINEAR TRACE CALLS FROM GERBER/EXCELLON or update and replace with CF POLYGONS.
- Methods in cf_composite_parent to verify.

- Add CommonForm complex shapes.
    - Update CFComplexParent to contain all 'squared shapes' all shapes that are bounded, so polygons and that curve
- Finish Gerber
    - Finish main GERBER switcher.
- Finish CFMethods
    - Create Core traces
    - Populate modified additive traces by subtracting subtractive from additive
    - Do this logic based on what outfiles are present.
    - CFIntersection detection and handling for additive + subtractive
    - look at unit of the cf method, convert the unit before making outfile
- GCode.
    - Write primary traces to print additive
    - Write secondary traces to print core


Future:
- Roll own CF Parametric Cubic Spline solution to save from having to be dependent on package.
- Add a math config to add variables when calculating math.
    -the number of samples from segment arc,
    -the number of samples from curves,
    -the number of samples from parametricCubSpline
- Update the logic behind circle segments when calculating distance too and from. Add some optimizations.
- Normalize code to have all points just use tupples [x,y]
- Put Gerber Aperture Macro and Aperture types under one parent to allow for similar methods to be merged.
